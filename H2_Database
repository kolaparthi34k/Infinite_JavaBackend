>H2 is a relational database management system written in Java. It can be embedded in Java applications or run in client-server mode. It's an in-memory database, meaning 
information stored in DB is transient and cleared with the application.
>H2 database is lightweight and excellent for POC and Test cases. The application can use any enterprise-grade database; however, a unit test for the data layer can use the H2 database.
>Spring boot has strong integration with the H2 database, and most of the configurations are provided by default using auto-configurations. Spring boot uses the H2 database in embedded mode.
As a result, database and application are part of the same process.
