Nuts and Bolts:

Cache
Memory-RAM
Loader-----utility or tool.Its job is to load something into memory.
Platform--o/s--windows/sun solaris/Mac/linux/As 400
Independent:if we are able to run code on windows,linux,mac,sun architectures.
we need tp call it as architecture neutral
i18n or Unicode

Bytecode: bytecode is a code which will be in 0,1 and some special characters/Symbols generated by JVM.

>>CAN WE CONVERT BYTECODE TO SOURCE CODE? use java decompiler s/w
>>CAN WE CONVERT sOURCECODE TO BYTECODE?JDK


>>write a code and we are going to save in .java format.
>>Using Javac ,we are going to compile the sourcecode.,finnaly bytecode will be generateed.
>>if any errors in code,execution will stop and bytecode will not be generated.
But 
bytecode will be in .class format.


>>Does java supports pointers?
ans)No. but Java  internally uses pointers.

>>At linking phase,we will verify and link/attach libraries to class file.

Functional Programming
=====================
>>  functions,procedures and Functional topics like loops,conditional statments,datatypes and operators.
>>main advanatge is modularity.
>>A function is block or group of commands or instructions which are used to achive a specific functionality.
>>There are 2 types of functions.
1)user-defined
2)Pre-defined

>Always the entry point will be main.Main functions is userdefined function."main" keyword is predefined.
>Always logic shld be with in function.
>>always functions returns some value.procedures or methods,they wont return anything.

==================
Day5
---------
>A package is a collection of Classes,interfaces,abstract class,methods,variables.
>Package are of 2 types.1)User defined 2)Pre-defined
>Any package which is part of your jdk is called as Pre-defined package.
>Any no of objects can objects for a class.
>>Memory will be allocated for an clASS once you create OBJECT.
System.out.println();
>>Method with body is called as concrete method.
>>>>Method without body is called as abstract method.

Uses of object creation:
1)Unnamed block will be called.
2)Memory allocation.
3)reference will be created.
4)Class level varaibles can be institilizaed at runtime using constructors.

Syntax:

<classname> reference=new <classname>();

Stat ref =  new Stat();
Left          right

new is mainly used for memory allocation
>Allways intitilize reference with null,we we are not allocating memory.

Constructor:
===========
>A constructor is a method whose name is same as class name.
>Constructors are used to intitilize class level variables.
>>constructors wont return any values.
>>constructors will be within class.
>constructors are of 3 types.
1)parametrized
2)empty/un-parametrized constructor
3)default: if developer is not providing any constructor,then JVM will provide default constructor.

>This always points to current class.
>>No 2 constructors can have same no of parameters with same datatype.Otherwise it will say duplicate constructor.

Task1:
create a java program  which class varaiable as int array and display the values in that array using display method.

>>Note:From JVM prospective,Evry java program is a thread.

>>>Overloading and Overriding:
===============================
>>Overloading means same name with different types and no of  parameters and if possible retrun type.
>Overloading occurs in same class.

Rules for Method Overloading:
==============================
The overloaded method must change the argument list (number of parameters, data type, or sequence of parameters).
The overloaded method can change the return type.
The overloaded method can change the access modifier (the signature of the function should be different).



Overriding:
================
>Overiding means using same function but in different classes.

Rules for Method Overiding:
===========================
>he argument list should be exactly the same as that of the overridden method.
The return type should be the same or a subtype of the return type declared in the original overridden method in the superclass.
The access level cannot be more restrictive than the overridden method's access level. For example: If the superclass method is declared public then the overriding method in the subclass cannot be either private or protected.
Instance methods can be overridden only if they are inherited by the subclass.
A method declared final cannot be overridden.
A method declared static cannot be overridden but can be re-declared.
If a method cannot be inherited, then it cannot be overridden.
A subclass within the same package as the instance's superclass can override any superclass method that is not declared private or final.
A subclass in a different package can only override the non-final methods declared public or protected.
An overriding method can throw any uncheck exceptions, regardless of whether the overridden method throws exceptions or not. However, the overriding method should not throw checked exceptions that are new or broader than the ones declared by the overridden method. The overriding method can throw narrower or fewer exceptions than the overridden method.
Constructors cannot be overridden.

>Any class which is declared as final cannot be inherited.
>A class can be private only in inner classes.


>parent/base/super class
>child or sub or derived class

>.IN java for evry class ,Object is the base class.
>javap java.lang.Object
javap is used for displaying the metadata about the provided class.

Interfaces and Abstract Classes:
=================================
Method without body is called as abstract method.

>>30 people
>>Sep 5th====>srinivas--->

Oct====>  

Interface------An interface is similar like class but with abstract methods.
>>We cannot create object for interface.
>by default all methods in interface are abstract.
>Any class can implement interface.
>>@Overide is called as annotation.Annotations will be indicated with '@' symbol.
>By default all varaible in interface are public static final.

=====================================================

Collections and ABstract classes:
===================================
>>Abstract class is a class with abstract methods.
>>abstract  classes are of 2 types.
1)pure abstract: only abstract methods
2)partially abstract: we will ahve both abstract and concrete methods.

Collections:
=============
>>collections can grow and shrink.
List is an interface.It allows duplicates.
>We can add/modify/delete Objects.
>All drawbacks in arrays can be overcomed using List.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html
>>Arraylist maintains insertion order.
>>To convert arrylist to array,use below method:
toArray()
>Iterator is mainly used for displaying data in a collection.It was specially designed for that.


for(<target> ref:Source)
{
}
>by default all collection will implements Cloneable, Serializable
>vector is syncronized and Arraylist is unsyncronized.

SET:
====
>set will not allow duplicates.
addAll() method in collections.
how do to remove duplicates from arraylist?

MAp will allow keys and values.no 2 keys can be same.


>>Test collections using null and "".

>>>Exception Handling:
=======================
>any abnormal conditional in program leads to errors messaging or termination of program.To deal with this,we are going to use
Exception handling.
>
Syntax:

try
{
}
catch(Exception e)
{
}
finally
{
}

even thourgh there is no error ,finnaly block will be executed.
>

try---catch/finally
try---finally
>finnaly cannot be nested.

All predefined exception extends Throwable.

>>Create a program for user defined exception.
revise some exceptiomns like ArrayIndexOutofboundsexceptions,nullpointer......
>checked and unchecked exceptions.
=======================================================
Day 6===> JDBC,Servlets,JSp
------------------------------
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>JDBC<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
>Pls cross check whether you were able to connect to mysql.
Db creation: create database training;
show databases;
>>use training;//switching among databases
>Wht is API?
API stands for Application program interface.An api is combination of classes,interfaces,methods designed for a specific purpose.
Every API has some set of rules defined.

MAinly API are used for connecting/communicate 2 or more different systems/terminals/PC/machines or applications.

API's are of 2 types.
1)predefined(Vendor)
2)Userdefined

App1(java)---------App2(.net)----API

>In simple it makes "API Calls" on the backend.
customer----Server----Chef
>>JDBC stands for Java database connectivity.
>JDBC gives us API's that can access any kind of RDBMS databases.
>>I want to save/persist/connecgt some data to backend database from frontend,then i can use JDBC.
RDBMS Databases: Oracle,Mysql,Postgress,Db2....etc.
>To design any app using JDBC,we need to have below S/ws.
1)Databases----Mysql
2)Datasource
3)JDBC API
4)Database tables---we are going to create employee table
5)Java Programming language

Employee table---->fullname,idno,department

Aaadhar--->firtname,lastname,address,voter card no,city,country

>Eclipse+Tomcat integration
>JDBC IS AN API TO CONNECT TO BACKEND DATABASE/SYSTEMS.

>Journey:
ODBC>>>>>>JDBC>>>>JPA(Hibernate)

>>JPS internally uses jdbc.

ODBC--->odbc stands for open database connectivity.
>ODbc is old technology,which is designed using c/C++.becuase of this this is platform dependent.
>odbc is mainly used for microsoft technologies like microsoft access,excel,wordpad.....etc.
>>odbc wont support remote databases.


>>oNLY BROWSER knows how to interact with server.No other component ion the world knows how to intreact with server effectively.
>Protocols: http/https
>browser will perform HTTP requests and HTTP responses.
>Without httprequest there is not http response.
>>In java if any APP want to communicate with database,it uses JDBC driver.
>>browser is also called as USERAGENT.it is alias name.
>>browser knows only http/https protocls.


Browser--->Type ur URL--->click hit button----->As sson as i click next--->http request will be created and will be forwared to DNS server--->from there request will be redirected to Microserver server---->it will check whether username is valid by interacting with microsoftdatabase---->if record is available/unavailable gives response to server---->filter----->browser 


>>request-response architecture.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>from java appp,i want to push my data to db for storing?
sol)JDBC/Hibernate

>>In this JDBC,we need to focus on drivers?
In jdbc we are having 4 types of drivers.There is also 5th driver.we wont focus on that.
https://github.com/kolaparthi34k/Infinite_JavaBackend/tree/main/Jdbc
>In projects we will use Type4 driver.

>IN jdbc we use java.sql and javax.sql packages.
x stands for xtension ie latest package or upgraded package from Oracle


Heavy weight===More memory and more CPU time
light weight===Less memory and less cpu time.

DB Connnection Pooling:
=======================
>DB connection object is a heavy weight.We shld know how to utilized db resources properly.Otherwise,handling more customer traffic will be difficult.
>DB Connnection Pooling will reduce burden on databases.It uses the connection resources in effective way ie reusability.
==========================================================

>>>In projects we will use Corrporate repositories.IT team will place all dependencies in a common corporate repository.
>Any repository that we create an organization for internal purpose is called as corporate repository.
TWe are going to use the tool NEXUS SONATYPE/Jfrog repository managers.
>Network that we create for internal purpose of an organization is called as INTRANET.
>IT team will perform Jar scanning for vulnarabilities.

=================================================
Day 8:
-----
Drawbacks:

1)Make the values insert at runtime.
Solution)Use PreparedStatement

2)connection closing shld be in final.Final will run irrespective of exceptions in the  code.
Solution)Can be handled in code.

3)Not portable
Solution)USe properties or XML files.

4)password shld not disclosed in code.
solution)if we need to use the password in code,encrypty the password and then use.
2)Place password in VAULT server or AWS Secrets manager  and pull password from  there.(prefered).Integrate vault code with JAva code.
3)USe properties file and place your encrypted password in properties or xml or YAML file.

5)driver class,url and passwords should be dynamic.
solution)can be achieved using 4 the step.

>Prepared statement,LOB datatypes,saving images in db,batch operation,calling functions using callable statements.

>>LOB datatypes:
=================
>>LOB stands for large objects.
LOB is of 3 types:
1)Blob--binary large object.Example:images,audio....etc
2)clob---character large object.Example:documents...etc
3)nclob--n no of character large objects.

>>>>SQL is db dependent.

Example: select * from tab; will work on oracle,but the same will not work in mYSQL.

>>SQL INJECTION
=====================
fiddle

SQL,PL/SQL(SQL+programming concepts),Forms and reports

>>Callable statements:used for clalling functions/Stored procudures in databases.
>>Prepared Statment:
>This is mainly for inserting values to the queries at runtime.
>Prepared statement helps us to avoid SQL INJECTIONs upto some extent80%.
To use effectly preparedstatement,if u follow the stands then Injection is not possible.
>In prepared statement,we use '?' as a place holder.
